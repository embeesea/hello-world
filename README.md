# hello-world
My first repository, learning how to use github
I am 45 years old, married with 3 adult children, 1 son, 1 daughter and 1 daughter-in-law.
I love to read and learn new things. I love to putter in the dirt and dream of taking the
time to grow a beautiful flower garden. I am learning to code software and am excited to
embark on a new career track as a developer.
